    <h1 style="color:#472156"><center>Why?</h1></center>
    <p>Watching movies can help us unwind, expand our imagination, and go to different places. It is also advised to release tension by immersing ourselves in a new universe. While it won't solve our issues, it can at least allow us to stop thinking about them for a while.  </p>

    <h1 style="color:#472156"><center>Why?</h1></center>
    <p>Music has the power to bring people together, make them feel at peace, and make them feel understood. It is a wonderful thing that communicates more than just sound.</p>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <img src="stories.jpg" alt="stories"  style="width:400px;height:300px;">

    <h1 style="color:#472156"><center>Why?</h1></center>

    <p>When you create new worlds, circumstances, and people in your work, creative writing expands your imagination. When you stimulate your brain to 'think outside the box,' you'll be better equipped to finding alternate solutions to difficulties and viewing challenges from other perspectives.</p>
